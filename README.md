# NavigatorUtil
Ah simple class (lib) which should help you to handle with the FragmentManger

## TODOS
* Write a better *README.md* ;D
* Adde Nexus deployment so you can use it as depencey in your project.
* Is the right place for the unit test? It does not feel like that => clarify that 

## Feedbacks 
Add animation functions like:
```java
mNavigator.goToWithInAnimation(SampleFragment.newInstance());
mNavigator.goToWithOutAnimation(SampleFragment.newInstance());
```
## Knowing Bugs
* If you add animaiton on the back pressed the animation don't get played
